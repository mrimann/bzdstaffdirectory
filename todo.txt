ToDo

- Move all the global configuration (from Extension Manager for example) to static TS-Setup.
	- Change code to reflect this (settings are now coming from another place)

- Allow a user to select the font for rendering the images of the email address in
  singleview (it's hardcoded at the moment - working with my template).

- Add a search form to search for a person (search in all fields)

- Idea: Add configuration, if detailed information on the team leader should be
  displayed in the teamlist

- Idea: Add a counter to show how many team members are in a team. Add configuration
  to activate/deactivate this feature.

- Idea: Add a fourth module listing all the teams available and let the user “surf”
  from team to team. This list page links to the team list page of each team.
	- Idea: Make it configuratble to show the team leader in this overview or not.

- Finish the documentation
	- Change the manual (now it's needed to include the static setup for the extension to work!)
	- Write a complete step-by-step tutorial
